## 📍 Phase 1: Basics of System Design

### ✅ Topics
- What is System Design? Why it's important
- High-Level Design (HLD) vs Low-Level Design (LLD)
- Client-Server Architecture
- Web Requests (HTTP, REST, WebSocket basics)
- Scalability: Vertical vs Horizontal
- Latency vs Throughput

### ✅ MERN Stack Relevance
- Understand how apps work under the hood
- Realize limits of Express, MongoDB, etc.

---

## 📍 Phase 2: Core Concepts

### ✅ Topics
- Load Balancers
- Caching (Redis, Memcached)
- Database Indexing & Query Optimization
- SQL vs NoSQL, CAP Theorem
- Replication, Sharding
- Consistent Hashing
- CDN (Cloudflare, Akamai)
- Rate Limiting
- API Gateway, Reverse Proxy
- Authentication vs Authorization

### ✅ MERN Stack Relevance
- Scaling Express APIs
- MongoDB performance optimization
- Redis caching strategies

---

## 📍 Phase 3: System Components Deep Dive

### ✅ Topics
- JWT vs OAuth2 Authentication
- Message Queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ, Redis Streams)
- File Storage (AWS S3, Cloudinary)
- Event-driven Architecture
- Database Transactions (ACID vs BASE)
- Search Systems (ElasticSearch)

### ✅ MERN Stack Relevance
- Decouple services using queues
- Optimize image/video storage
- Build robust search and auth systems

---

## 📍 Phase 4: Real-world Scalable System Design (HLD)

### ✅ Sample Design Problems
- URL Shortener (Bit.ly)
- Instagram Feed System
- WhatsApp Chat Application
- YouTube-like Video Streaming
- E-commerce Platform (Shopeasy)
- Food Delivery App (Zomato, UberEats)

### ✅ Key Skills
- Architecture Diagrams
- Data Flow & Scaling Bottlenecks
- Choosing the Right Tools

---

## 📍 Phase 5: Low-Level Design (LLD)

### ✅ Topics
- SOLID Principles
- Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton, Observer, etc.)
- Modular Architecture
- Interface Design
- Dependency Injection

### ✅ MERN Stack Relevance
- Reusable service layers in Express
- Better folder/file structure
- Cleaner, testable code

---

## 📍 Phase 6: DevOps & Production Readiness

### ✅ Topics
- Docker & Containerization
- CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Jenkins)
- Nginx, PM2, Node.js Clustering
- Monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana)
- Logging (Winston, ELK Stack)
- Circuit Breakers, Rate Limiting

### ✅ MERN Stack Relevance
- Deploy robust, production-ready systems
- Containerize and monitor full-stack apps
